# Supplementary captions

**Supplementary Table ST1 — Execution summary (cell-culture run).**
English: Execution summary for all jobs in the cell-culture run. Columns: reservation_time (time scheduling was performed; tentative under dynamic scheduling), optimal_start_time, scheduled_time, execution_start_time, processing_time, experiment_operation, experiment_uuid.

**Supplementary Table ST2 — State-transition history (TSV).**
English: State-transition history across all experiments (TSV). Each row records the state reached at each discrete step; columns list individual experiments, corresponding to Supplementary Video S3.

**Supplementary Video S1 — Experiment-level Gantt animation.**
English: Gantt animation grouped by experiment for the cell-culture run, showing reservation, optimal, scheduled, and actual start times over wall-clock time. (The colour-mixing experiment executed immediately and has no timeline.)

**Supplementary Video S2 — Operation-level Gantt animation.**
English: Gantt animation grouped by operation type (e.g., imaging, passaging, medium change), showing reservation, optimal, scheduled, and actual start times across experiments. (Colour-mixing has no timeline.)

**Supplementary Video S3 — State-transition animation.**
English: Animation of state progression over discrete steps, independent of wall-clock time; table counterpart is Supplementary Table ST2.
